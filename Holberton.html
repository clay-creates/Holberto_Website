    <h1>I am Clay!</h1>

    <p>I would like to pursue software engineering for a few different reasons, one of the biggest reasons is, for the doors that I believe this field will open for me. I went to college as an undergrad and graduated with a degree in photography, while in school I setudied design and art history as well. After graduating college, finding work that was enjoyable and realistic for me was difficult and I have ended up working a lot of customer service jobs instead. I want to pursue software engineering in order to reskill and enter a new field of work that I believe would be both engaging and rewarding. I believe the software engineering would be a field that would allow for me to grow and succeed  while solving problems and continually learning.</p>

    <p>After Holberton, I hope to find work using the skills that I have learned while continuing to learn. Ideally I would like to find work at a place that focuses on accessability and problem-solving both interpersonally and community wide. I have a few ideas for apps that I would like to research and think about creating at some point, a lot of my focus surrounds the idea of taking struggle / stress out of people's ways, especially when it comes to everyday tasks. Alongside the excitement I feel for a field that encourages such learning, I hope that sucess in this field will also allow a path towards financial freedom. It has long been a dream of mine to pay off my debts to society and then begin to build weath that I can then share with my community and loved ones in order to help others live more accessable and joyful lives.</p>

    <p>Listing Holberton's program options in the order I am most interested would look like this: <ol><li>Full-Stack Web Development</li><li>Computer Science &amp; Machine Learning</li><li>Computer Science &amp; Augmented Reality &amp; Virtual Reality</li><li>Computer Science &amp; Linux Programming, Advanced Algorithms &amp; Blockchain</li></ol> </p>

    <p>(As described on Holberton's site) Full-Stack web development refers to the entire scope of building and maintaining websites and mobile applications. Full Stack includes everything from front-end user interface design (what people see and interact with when they go to a website) to back-end data management (storage and access for information on the site, like inventory for a store, for example). Full-Stack development is the most interesting program for me because of the variety of tools and languages to learn and use for a broad amount of uses. Along with my previous design knowledge from undergraduate being a benefit for learning front-end, I feel like Full-Stack Development would allow me the greatest amount of growth and enjoyment in learning, while also providing me with the tools to be build and maintain developments across the spectrum. </p>
